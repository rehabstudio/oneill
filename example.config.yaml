# This file shows all possible settings keys with explanations on the use of

# see README.md for explanation of appropriate values for `definitions_uri`
definitions_uri: "file:///etc/oneill/definitions"

# If true, all nginx functionality will be completely disabled. Use this if
# you're solely running containers that shouldn't be exposed to the internet
# or if you're using some other tool for service discovery and routing.
nginx_disabled: false

# The directory to which nginx configuration files should be written. Note
# that oneill expects to own this directory and will remove any files
# contained within the folder if they don't match a running container.
nginx_config_directory: "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled"

# The directory to which nginx will place the generated htpasswd files. Note
# that oneill will create dynamically generated htpasswd files in this
# directory so it needs to be able to write to this folder.
nginx_htpasswd_directory: "/etc/nginx/htpasswd"

# If true, no SSL related configuration will be included in the vhost
# configuration files generated for use with nginx.
nginx_ssl_disabled: false

# nginx_ssl_cert is the path to the SSL certificate bundle. Required if
# nginx_ssl_disabled is false.
nginx_ssl_cert: /etc/ssl/certs/oneill.crt

# nginx_ssl_key is the path to the SSL private key file. Required if
# nginx_ssl_disabled is false.
nginx_ssl_key: /etc/ssl/private/oneill.pem

# log_level controls the amount of output produced by oneill. The following
# values are permitted: debug, info, warning, error, fatal, panic
log_level: info

# The domain specified here will be used when generating nginx configuration
# files for the containers. This should be a valid domain name/hostname that
# resolves to the system running oneill. If you want subdomains created by
# oneill to work automatically you should create a `*.example.com` DNS A
# record pointing at the server running oneill.
serving_domain: example.com

# registry_credentials is a map in which you can specify login details for any
# private registry you wish to use with oneill (you can ignore this if your
# private registry does not require login). The keys should be the name/url
# (without scheme) of the registry, the values should be another map
# containing both the username and password that should be used for each
# registry.
#
# Note: There are no default values provided for registry credentials, but an
# example is shown below.
registry_credentials:
    registry.example.com:
        username: user@example.com
        password: examplepassword
    another-registry.example.com:
        username: anotheruser@example.com
        password: anotherexamplepassword
